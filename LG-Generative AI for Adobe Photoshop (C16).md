## Topic 1 — GenAI for Visual Communication

Turn an audience need into an intentional, rights-aware visual direction.


### Human-led GenAI Creative Loop

A human defines the brief, directs generation, selects evidence and remains accountable for publication.

**Best used for:** Fast exploration where intent and judgement matter more than raw variation count.

**Key controls:** Brief · prompt · variation · critique · edit · verify

**Watch for:** Automating the decision as well as the production.

**Quality evidence:** A decision log connects the selected visual to audience, purpose and acceptance criteria.

### GenAI Image Use Cases and Boundaries

Generation, insertion, removal, expansion and translation solve different visual problems and carry different risks.

**Best used for:** Choosing an appropriate AI feature before opening a tool.

**Key controls:** Task type · rights · sensitivity · required control · delivery channel

**Watch for:** Using generation where faithful documentation is required.

**Quality evidence:** The chosen feature and boundary are justified against the brief.

### Prompt Anatomy

A useful prompt combines subject, action, setting, visual treatment, composition and constraints.

**Best used for:** Creating a clear starting direction without over-prescribing every pixel.

**Key controls:** Subject · action · setting · medium · lighting · camera · exclusions

**Watch for:** Contradictory adjectives, vague subjects and accidental text instructions.

**Quality evidence:** Prompt components can be traced to visible properties of the result.

### Prompt Iteration and Variation

Changing one prompt factor at a time makes cause and effect observable.

**Best used for:** Converging from a broad direction to a defensible final candidate.

**Key controls:** Baseline · single-variable change · seed/variation · comparison notes

**Watch for:** Changing model, prompt, style and composition simultaneously.

**Quality evidence:** A contact sheet shows at least three labelled iterations and the selection reason.

### Visual Hierarchy and Emphasis

Scale, contrast, position, isolation and detail establish what viewers notice first.

**Best used for:** Campaign visuals that need a clear focal point and reading order.

**Key controls:** Primary focal point · secondary cue · supporting detail · CTA space

**Watch for:** Competing focal points or an empty area that cannot hold useful copy.

**Quality evidence:** A squint test and thumbnail view preserve the intended reading order.

### Scale, Balance and Alignment

Relative size signals importance; visual mass and common edges stabilise the composition.

**Best used for:** Combining generated imagery with typography or brand elements.

**Key controls:** Scale ratio · visual weight · grid · edge alignment · safe area

**Watch for:** Centred-by-default layouts or tangencies that feel accidental.

**Quality evidence:** Guides and a reduced-size review confirm balance across the frame.

### Contrast, Repetition and Negative Space

Contrast separates roles, repetition creates coherence and negative space gives the message room to breathe.

**Best used for:** Social tiles, posters and storyboard frames that must scan quickly.

**Key controls:** Value contrast · colour contrast · repeated motif · breathing room

**Watch for:** Decorative repetition that overwhelms the subject.

**Quality evidence:** Grayscale and thumbnail checks confirm separation and rhythm.

### Audience, Story and Responsible Provenance

A visual is credible when its message fits the audience and its source, prompts and edits remain explainable.

**Best used for:** Commercial, organisational and public-facing visual communication.

**Key controls:** Audience need · claim risk · asset rights · prompt log · Content Credentials

**Watch for:** Misleading realism, unlicensed references or unsupported claims.

**Quality evidence:** A provenance note accompanies the editable master and export.

### Lab 01 — Prompt-to-Image Visual Brief

**Scenario:** A reading campaign needs an imaginative hero image with clear copy space for a social tile.

**Objective:** Translate an audience brief into a controlled Firefly prompt set and selected visual direction.

#### Detailed procedure

1. Create a folder named `working` and preserve the supplied JPEGs unchanged.
2. Write a one-sentence brief naming audience, message, channel, aspect ratio and required copy space.
3. Draft a baseline prompt using subject, action, setting, visual treatment, composition and lighting.
4. Generate a first set in Firefly and record the model and content type used.
5. Change only one prompt factor for iteration two; label the changed factor.
6. Change a different single factor for iteration three; retain all three prompt/result records.
7. Compare the candidates for hierarchy, copy space, artefacts, audience fit and rights/provenance.
8. Export the selected candidate as `lab01-selected.jpg` and save `lab01-decision-log.txt`.

#### Evidence

Three prompt/result records, selected JPEG and decision log identifying A1 exploration and A2 integration decisions.

#### Acceptance criteria

- At least three controlled prompt iterations are retained.
- The selected JPEG has a clear focal point and intentional copy space.
- The log records model, prompt, selection reason and provenance consideration.

### Lab 02 — Design Principles and Prompt Refinement

**Scenario:** A creative studio wants a poster-ready yarn-art visual with one strong headline zone.

**Objective:** Use Photoshop layout evidence to refine a generated visual against hierarchy, balance and contrast criteria.

#### Detailed procedure

1. Open `structure-reference.psd` and immediately save `lab02-working.psd`.
2. Inspect layer names, canvas ratio, dominant lines and negative-space zones.
3. Create guides for a primary focal area, headline zone and safe margins.
4. Write a Firefly prompt that preserves the structural intent while changing subject or material.
5. Generate at least two candidates and place them as separate Smart Object layers.
6. Add editable placeholder type to test hierarchy; do not embed essential copy in generated pixels.
7. Compare scale, alignment, value contrast and breathing room at Fit and thumbnail views.
8. Retain the stronger candidate, name all layers and export `lab02-poster.jpg`.

#### Evidence

Layered PSD, exported JPEG and a short comparison note covering the design principles.

#### Acceptance criteria

- PSD contains guides, editable type and separate candidate layers.
- The final hierarchy remains clear at thumbnail size.
- Comparison note cites at least three explicit design criteria.

## Topic 2 — Firefly Storyboards and Reference Control

Control composition and style, then organise variations into a communicable flow.


### Choosing a Firefly Image Model

Firefly models offer different balances of speed, realism, prompt interpretation and control.

**Best used for:** Matching generation quality and latency to the storyboard purpose.

**Key controls:** Current model · output intent · speed · detail · available controls

**Watch for:** Assuming the newest model behaves identically to an older one.

**Quality evidence:** The selected model is recorded with a visible comparison or reason.

### Content Type and Visual Intensity

Content type steers photo/illustration behaviour while visual intensity adjusts how strongly styling affects the result.

**Best used for:** Moving between documentary-looking and illustrative storyboard frames.

**Key controls:** Photo/art · auto mode · visual intensity · effects

**Watch for:** Treating intensity as a substitute for a clear prompt.

**Quality evidence:** Two controlled variants demonstrate the effect of the setting.

### Colour, Lighting and Camera Controls

Secondary controls guide palette, lighting direction, field of view and depth cues.

**Best used for:** Keeping a sequence visually coherent without copying every frame.

**Key controls:** Colour/tone · lighting · camera angle · lens/depth cues

**Watch for:** A lighting instruction that conflicts with the reference composition.

**Quality evidence:** Frames share a documented palette and plausible light direction.

### Composition Reference

A composition reference transfers spatial arrangement and structural relationships without duplicating the source pixels.

**Best used for:** Maintaining camera position, pose or layout across storyboard alternatives.

**Key controls:** Reference strength · crop · silhouette · dominant lines · prompt

**Watch for:** Using a reference without rights or expecting identity fidelity.

**Quality evidence:** Overlay or side-by-side evidence confirms structural similarity.

### Style Reference

A style reference guides colour, texture, lighting and rendering character while the prompt controls subject matter.

**Best used for:** Unifying multiple scenes under one art direction.

**Key controls:** Reference strength · visual intensity · effects · prompt specificity

**Watch for:** Combining style and composition changes without a baseline.

**Quality evidence:** A contact sheet shows consistent treatment across different subjects.

### Storyboard Architecture

A storyboard converts a narrative into beats with a purpose, frame, transition and evidence for each beat.

**Best used for:** Explaining an experience, campaign sequence or task journey.

**Key controls:** Opening · context · action · transformation · outcome · CTA

**Watch for:** A gallery of attractive images with no causal sequence.

**Quality evidence:** Every frame has a caption, purpose and transition note.

### Task Flow for Team Collaboration

A task flow assigns inputs, decisions, hand-offs and review gates so visual work can be repeated by a team.

**Best used for:** Moving from ideation to approved, editable and channel-ready output.

**Key controls:** Owner · input · action · decision · output · reviewer

**Watch for:** Unowned approval steps or ambiguous version names.

**Quality evidence:** A flow diagram identifies ownership and acceptance at each gate.

### Text Effects and Template Ideation

Text effects and template-oriented generation can establish art direction, but final copy remains editable in the design tool.

**Best used for:** Exploring campaign style, title treatment and modular layouts.

**Key controls:** Short display phrase · material/style · legibility · editability

**Watch for:** Embedding essential long-form copy inside generated pixels.

**Quality evidence:** Final deliverable uses editable type and passes a legibility check.

### Lab 03 — Composition and Style References

**Scenario:** A wellness campaign needs varied subjects that retain one composition and art direction.

**Objective:** Create a controlled Firefly comparison using composition and style references independently and together.

#### Detailed procedure

1. Confirm the supplied references are used only for this authorised learning activity.
2. Write one subject prompt and generate a baseline without references.
3. Add `composition-reference.jpg`, select a moderate strength and generate a second set.
4. Remove the composition reference, add `style-reference.jpg` and generate a third set.
5. Apply both references and generate a fourth set without changing the core subject prompt.
6. Export one candidate from each condition using descriptive filenames.
7. Create a four-up comparison canvas in Photoshop with editable labels.
8. Record which setting best controlled structure, treatment and campaign consistency.

#### Evidence

Four labelled JPEG conditions, comparison PSD and a reference-control decision note.

#### Acceptance criteria

- Baseline, composition-only, style-only and combined results are present.
- Only the intended reference condition changes between comparisons.
- Decision note distinguishes structural and stylistic influence.

### Lab 04 — Storyboard and Task Flow

**Scenario:** A fictional Wellness Week Singapore 2026 campaign needs a short visual journey from stress to restorative action.

**Objective:** Build a five-frame Firefly storyboard and a team task flow that communicates intent and ownership.

#### Detailed procedure

1. Save the PSD as `lab04-storyboard.psd` and inspect its editable frame structure.
2. Write five beats: opening, context, action, transformation and outcome/CTA.
3. Define a shared palette, lighting direction, aspect ratio and style reference for the sequence.
4. Generate one candidate for each beat, keeping the documented shared controls constant.
5. Place each candidate in its own Smart Object frame and add editable captions.
6. Create a task-flow panel naming owner, input, action, review gate and output for generation, Photoshop edit and approval.
7. Review continuity of subject, palette, lighting and causal sequence with a peer.
8. Revise one frame, record the reason and export `lab04-storyboard.jpg`.

#### Evidence

Five-frame layered storyboard PSD, exported JPEG, task-flow panel and peer-review note.

#### Acceptance criteria

- Every frame has a purpose and transition caption.
- Task flow includes ownership and an approval gate.
- At least one revision is traceable to stakeholder or peer feedback.

## Topic 3 — Photoshop Generative Editing and Critique

Use selections and generative features to build, evaluate and improve editable composites.


### Photoshop Generative AI Feature Map

Photoshop connects Generative Fill, Expand, Background, Harmonize and reference-based generation to selections and layers.

**Best used for:** Selecting the smallest feature that solves the editing problem.

**Key controls:** Selection · prompt/reference · model · variations · generated layer

**Watch for:** Flattening before review or confusing destructive and generated edits.

**Quality evidence:** The Layers panel shows the generated content and editable source structure.

### Selection as a Generative Instruction

Selection geometry defines where change may occur and gives the model contextual pixels at its boundary.

**Best used for:** Precise insertion, replacement and local repair.

**Key controls:** Selection edge · feather · context margin · mask · target layer

**Watch for:** Selections that clip shadows or include protected details.

**Quality evidence:** Selection/mask evidence and a 100% edge inspection are retained.

### Generative Fill

Generative Fill creates non-destructive variations on a new generated layer inside the selected region.

**Best used for:** Adding, replacing or removing local content with contextual blending.

**Key controls:** Prompt or blank prompt · model · variation · generated layer

**Watch for:** Anatomy errors, repeated textures and lighting mismatch.

**Quality evidence:** Before/after, selected variation and layered PSD prove the decision.

### Generative Expand

Generative Expand extends the canvas and synthesises contextual pixels beyond the original frame.

**Best used for:** Reframing a master visual for landscape, portrait and square channels.

**Key controls:** Crop ratio · anchor · prompt/blank · safe area · variation

**Watch for:** Extending low-quality edges or moving the focal point unintentionally.

**Quality evidence:** Three channel crops preserve subject integrity and useful copy space.

### Generate Background and Harmonize

Background generation replaces the environment; Harmonize adjusts a placed subject to the surrounding tone, colour and light.

**Best used for:** Fast composites that still require realistic integration.

**Key controls:** Subject isolation · background prompt · scale · contact shadow · Harmonize

**Watch for:** Floating subjects, incorrect perspective or inconsistent light direction.

**Quality evidence:** Layered before/after and zoomed edge/shadow evidence pass review.

### Reference Image in Generative Fill

A reference image provides additional visual guidance while the prompt and selection define the requested change.

**Best used for:** Improving consistency of an object, material or visual direction.

**Key controls:** Reference asset · rights · prompt · selection · variation

**Watch for:** Expecting an exact copy or using a reference without permission.

**Quality evidence:** The reference, selected output and rights record are stored together.

### Inpainting and Outpainting

Inpainting changes content inside a boundary; outpainting synthesises beyond an existing boundary.

**Best used for:** Choosing between local repair and frame extension.

**Key controls:** Protected area · context overlap · seam location · content continuity

**Watch for:** Visible seams, repeated objects or altered protected content.

**Quality evidence:** A difference review confirms only the intended region changed.

### Aesthetic Critique and Golden-ratio Heuristics

Critique separates description, interpretation, evaluation and recommendation; compositional heuristics are prompts for judgement, not guarantees.

**Best used for:** Explaining why a visual works and proposing an actionable revision.

**Key controls:** Hierarchy · balance · rhythm · focal placement · audience fit · technical finish

**Watch for:** Treating a grid or ratio as proof of quality.

**Quality evidence:** A criterion-based critique identifies evidence, impact and one testable change.

### Lab 05 — Generative Fill: Directed Inpainting

**Scenario:** An editorial wildlife visual needs a plausible environmental detail without damaging the original subject.

**Objective:** Use a controlled selection and Generative Fill to add, replace and remove content non-destructively.

#### Detailed procedure

1. Open `elephant-start.psd` and save `lab05-generative-fill.psd`.
2. Duplicate the source group and identify protected subject edges.
3. Draw a selection with enough surrounding context for one added environmental detail.
4. Run Generative Fill with a concise prompt and retain at least three variations.
5. Select the strongest variation by edge, light, scale and narrative fit.
6. Create a second selection and use a blank prompt for a controlled removal.
7. Inspect both edits at Fit and 100%, refining masks without flattening.
8. Export `lab05-final.jpg` and capture the Layers panel as evidence.

#### Evidence

Layered PSD, selected variations, final JPEG and zoomed edge/Layers-panel evidence.

#### Acceptance criteria

- Original pixels remain protected.
- Generated edits are on named generated layers with editable masks.
- Edges, lighting and scale pass 100% inspection.

## Topic 4 — Colour Strategy, Enhancement and Delivery

Build a coherent palette, preserve editability and verify the delivered visual.


### Hue, Saturation, Brightness and Value

Hue identifies colour family, saturation its intensity, and value/brightness its light-dark position.

**Best used for:** Diagnosing palette and separation before choosing an adjustment.

**Key controls:** Hue relationship · saturation range · value contrast · skin/brand constraints

**Watch for:** Increasing saturation when the problem is value separation.

**Quality evidence:** A palette swatch and grayscale review support the colour decision.

### Adjustment Layers and Masks

Adjustment layers store tonal or colour changes separately; masks control where each adjustment applies.

**Best used for:** Reversible campaign colour work and local corrections.

**Key controls:** Adjustment type · layer order · mask density · blend mode · opacity

**Watch for:** Painting directly on the only copy or leaving masks unnamed.

**Quality evidence:** Named adjustment layers and masks remain editable in the PSD.

### Histogram and Levels

The histogram displays tonal distribution; Levels remaps black point, white point and midtones.

**Best used for:** Correcting global tonal range and identifying clipping.

**Key controls:** Channel · black point · gamma · white point · output levels

**Watch for:** Forcing every image to fill the histogram or clipping detail.

**Quality evidence:** Before/after histograms and highlight/shadow checks show controlled range.

### Curves

Curves remaps input to output values with points that target overall tone or individual colour channels.

**Best used for:** Fine contrast shaping and colour-balance correction.

**Key controls:** Anchor points · slope · channel · mask · clipping preview

**Watch for:** Too many points, banding or unwanted colour casts.

**Quality evidence:** A labelled Curves layer and before/after comparison show the intended change.

### Colour Balance and Hue/Saturation

Colour Balance shifts tonal ranges toward complementary colours; Hue/Saturation targets hue families and intensity.

**Best used for:** Harmonising composite elements and establishing a campaign palette.

**Key controls:** Shadows/midtones/highlights · target colour range · saturation · mask

**Watch for:** Global shifts that damage skin tones, neutrals or brand colours.

**Quality evidence:** Sampled swatches and targeted masks demonstrate controlled application.

### Neural Filters and Restoration

Neural Filters provide AI-assisted transformations that can output to a new layer for further review.

**Best used for:** Restoration, colourisation and portrait enhancement where source evidence is incomplete.

**Key controls:** Filter model · strength · output method · local cleanup · review

**Watch for:** Invented detail, identity changes or treating an AI result as historical fact.

**Quality evidence:** Original, AI output and manual corrections remain separately reviewable.

### Campaign Colour Consistency

A campaign palette combines role-based colours, contrast targets and adjustment recipes across assets.

**Best used for:** Keeping storyboard, social and poster outputs recognisably related.

**Key controls:** Primary/secondary/accent roles · value range · accessibility · export profile

**Watch for:** Matching hex values while ignoring surrounding colour and output profile.

**Quality evidence:** A palette sheet and three channel exports show consistent roles.

### Output Verification and Content Credentials

Professional delivery includes export settings, reopen checks, provenance and a retained editable master.

**Best used for:** Hand-off to stakeholders, publication and audit-ready delivery.

**Key controls:** Format · dimensions · profile · compression · metadata · Content Credentials

**Watch for:** Assuming an exported file is correct without reopening it.

**Quality evidence:** PSD, verified JPEG and provenance/read-me record form one evidence package.

### Lab 09 — Restoration, Critique and Colour Strategy

**Scenario:** An archive image will support a heritage-wellness story but must not imply certainty where AI reconstructs missing detail.

**Objective:** Restore a damaged image, evaluate invented detail and develop a reversible colour treatment.

#### Detailed procedure

1. Open the damaged PSD and save `lab09-restoration.psd` without altering the original layer.
2. Use a Neural Filter or restoration workflow with output set to a new layer.
3. Inspect faces, hands, edges and repeating texture; mask or retouch unsupported artefacts.
4. Create a Levels or Curves adjustment layer to establish usable tonal range without clipping.
5. Develop a restrained palette using Colour Balance or Hue/Saturation adjustment layers and masks.
6. Compare the original, AI-only and corrected states at Fit and 100%.
7. Write a critique distinguishing observed source detail from AI-inferred detail.
8. Export `lab09-final.jpg` and retain a palette swatch layer in the PSD.

#### Evidence

Layered restoration PSD, verified JPEG, palette swatches and critique of AI-inferred detail.

#### Acceptance criteria

- Original, AI output and manual corrections remain separately reviewable.
- Tonal range avoids unintended highlight/shadow clipping.
- The critique discloses uncertainty and proposes a defensible enhancement.

### Lab 10 — Wellness Campaign Capstone

**Scenario:** Fictional Wellness Week Singapore 2026 needs a coherent hero visual and three channel exports for a positive, inclusive message.

**Objective:** Integrate the full workflow into an editable campaign visual, storyboard summary, critique and colour-delivery package.

#### Detailed procedure

1. Open the starter PSD, save `lab10-capstone.psd` and write a brief naming audience, message and channels.
2. Explore at least two Firefly directions; record prompt, model, references and selection rationale.
3. Integrate the selected result with the supplied PSD using named layers, masks and generated layers.
4. Create a three-frame storyboard strip showing problem, restorative action and outcome/CTA.
5. Ask a peer to evaluate hierarchy, inclusivity, aesthetics, technical finish and message fit; record the feedback.
6. Propose and implement at least two traceable enhancements based on the critique.
7. Create a role-based colour strategy with primary, secondary and accent swatches plus reversible adjustment layers.
8. Export square, landscape and portrait JPEGs; reopen each and record dimensions, colour profile and visual verification.

#### Evidence

Layered master PSD, prompt log, storyboard strip, peer critique, enhancement record, palette and three verified JPEGs.

#### Acceptance criteria

- The package visibly demonstrates the full workflow.
- All adjustments and generated elements remain editable and named.
- Three exports are reopened and pass dimension, colour and visual checks.
- Provenance and asset-permission notes accompany delivery.
